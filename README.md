# insert_copyright_into_Java_src_using_git_log

Just started.

I planed to write simple python scripts to insert copyright into Java source codes comitted in [Mass++ ver4](https://github.com/masspp/mspp4) repository. 
First commited author and date is extracted from git log, and used to generate JavaDoc style copyright.

I think such scripts are useful for someone else.
(I found maven has functionality to insert license header into java source files today.
If I find existing useful scripts to insert copyright into java codes, I report them here instead of writing codes.)

Anyway, I will complete this project this year.
